# gRPC

## Background
I was interested in learning about gRPC and followed the [official site's tutorial in Python]((https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart).

## Setup
```bash
python -m pip install grpcio
python -m pip install grpcio-tools
```

## Run Hello World
```bash
# In one terminal window
python greeter_server.py

# In another terminal window
python greeter_client.py
```
