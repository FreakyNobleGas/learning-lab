After a hard fought battle with a particularly tough Werewolf, renowned Witcher Geralt of Rivia is in need
of some new armor. Fortunately, there was a bounty for the recently defeated beast, and for his triumph Geralt
 has received a good bit of coin ( called Crowns ). Traveling to a nearby armorer, Geralt is faced with more 
 options than he is used to. Given his funds, the Witcher needs to purchase an armor set with the highest 
 possible total armor value.

Create a program that will determine the armor set of the highest value based on Geralt’s available currency
( Crowns ). An armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as
 an extra piece that can be of any type.

    - 300 Crowns Available
    - You must be able to afford the total price of your armor set given your available Crowns
    - Each piece of armor contains a type, name, price, and armor value
    - Remember, an armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type
    - Inventory in Armorer’s shop provided (https://s3.amazonaws.com/o.www.ign.com/code-foo/2019/static/Witcher+Inventory+(1).pdf)
    - Display the final answer.
    - Explain how you implemented the solution. Is your solution successful with other inventories?
