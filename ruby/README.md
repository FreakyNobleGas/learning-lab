## Overview
I'm using the repository to hold all of my learnings and exercises from the book, "Head First Ruby" by Jay McGavren".

# Helpful CLI Commands
- `ruby -v` to get interpreter version
- `ruby program-to-run.rb` to execute a ruby file
- `irb` to run ruby's REPL to test snippets of code (also called irb for interactive ruby)

# Helpful Knowledge Points
- ruby is a scripting language similar to Python
- variables are typically written in snake case and lower-case (e.g. my_variable)
- Everything is an object in ruby, including numbers which have their own methods
- If a method takes no arguments, then it is idiomatic to not include parenthesis

# Important Methods
- `.inspects` is used for debugging (i.e. `puts input.inspect` or `p inspect`)
- `.class` returns the object's class
- `.methods` returns a list of all of the object's methods
