# Overview
The code in this repository was created following Jonathan Mill's PluralSight course "Building Web Applications with Node.js and Express"

# Concepts
In this code, I have implemented a web application using Node.js, Express, EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating), and debugging tooling such as morgan, chalk, and debug.

The entry point for this web application is app.js, which creates a router for conference sessions in the fictional Globomantics website. The router instruments dynamic routing using the session ID from each session defined in a JSON data file.
